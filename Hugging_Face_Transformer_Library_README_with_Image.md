## Core Components

### 1. **Models**

- Provides easy access to a vast repository of pre-trained models.
- Models are hosted on the Hugging Face Hub and can be loaded with a single line of code.

### 2. **Tokenizers**

- Supports fast and efficient tokenization with tools like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), WordPiece, and SentencePiece.
- Includes "Fast" tokenizers built using Rust for speed and performance.

### 3. **Pipelines**

- High-level abstraction for end-to-end tasks like text generation (`Text2TextGenerationPipeline`), machine translation (`TranslationPipeline`), and zero-shot classification (`ZeroShotClassificationPipeline`).

### 4. **Datasets Integration**

- Seamless integration with Hugging Face Datasets for downloading, processing, and preparing datasets for training and evaluation.

### 5. **Trainer API**

- Simplifies the fine-tuning process with built-in support for training loops, evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization.
- Supports distributed training across multiple GPUs or TPUs.

## Installation

Transformers can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install transformers
```

For additional performance benefits, install the "Fast" tokenizers:

```bash
pip install transformers[torch]  # For PyTorch backend
pip install transformers[tensorflow]  # For TensorFlow backend
```

## Quickstart

### Text Classification Example

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained pipeline for sentiment analysis
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Analyze sentiment
result = classifier("Hugging Face Transformers is amazing!")
print(result)  # [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998}]
```

### Fine-Tuning a Pre-Trained Model

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load dataset and model
dataset = load_dataset("imdb")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=2)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir="./logs",
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=dataset["test"],
)

# Train and evaluate
trainer.train()

# Evaluate and show predictions
eval_results = trainer.evaluate()
print("Evaluation Results:", eval_results)

# Make predictions on new data
predictions = trainer.predict(dataset["test"])
print("Sample Predictions:", predictions.predictions[:5])
```
